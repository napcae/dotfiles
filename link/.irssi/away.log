18:19 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/TheEternalAbyss_4/:» ehi.. what would the irc command be to killa  ghost nick?
22:00 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/Ziber4/:» eI forget how big this channel is sometimes, since I don't have a nicklist all the time.
22:16 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/Woet4/:» enick2474: one billion?
22:18 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/Woet4/:» enick2474: well, you will probably want to start with getting your own IP allocation
22:30 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/fbh4/:» enick2474: Asking that question sort of tells you to _not_ do this yourself and instead pay someone who is good at e-mail to help you :)
22:31 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/Woet4/:» enick2474: and I've already told you twice that shared IP ranges like digital ocean are going to be very bad for your reputation
22:33 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/Woet4/:» enick2474: sounds like you just need to use a provider like mailchimp.com
22:34 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/Woet4/:» enick2474: as I said, if the costs are a problem then you (or your customers) are doing something wrong or illegal
22:35 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/movedx4/:» enick2474: How many e-mails do you need to send?
22:35 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/fbh4/:» enick2474: If they charge a lot, the e-mail you are going to send is not legitimate. If e-mail marketing is used for legitimate things, the conversion rate of the e-mails will be way enough to pay for the e-mails themselves.
22:35 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/Woet4/:» e[22:17:32] <nick2474> i dont need one billion, but 200,000 by month is enought
22:45 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/Woet4/:» enick2474: how do you mean?
22:46 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/fbh4/:» enick2474: Providers like sendgrid and mandrill do not sell your e-mail lists.. they'd be looong gone by now if they did... (and not trusted by large corporations)
22:48 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/fbh4/:» enick2474: And the problem with e.g. SendGrid is??
22:48 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/Woet4/:» enick2474: what evidence do you have that providers like mailgun/mailchimp/sendgrid sell your subscribers?
22:48 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/movedx4/:» eYou could just setup your own mail server to do this, nick2474. Just make sure you get the setup correct: SPF records, DKIM if you're serious, PTR records, etc.
22:50 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/Woet4/:» enick2474: then run an outgoing e-mail server on digitalocean
22:51 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/fbh4/:» enick2474: Bull... It has nothing to do with "confidentiality".. Huge companies like Spotify and Pinterest uses services like SendGrid for their e-mail delivery.

03:53 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/mocx4/:» ehow is that nick not taken and protected?
03:53 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/retran4/:» ethis chan dont require nickserv
03:53 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/mocx4/:» ethat has nothing to do with protecting the nick
03:55 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/retran4/:» eseems we could avoid many trolls and deceptive nicks by requiring nickserv
03:57 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/mocx4/:» elisten, NickServ has an enforce command that protects anyone from trying to use your nick
03:57 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/retran4/:» eand NickServ isn't a requirement to getting into freenode
03:58 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/retran4/:» ei guess probably NickServ requiprement is too rigid
03:59 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/mrrcp4/:» eusually the IRCD blocks specific nicks but its only *Serv nicks
04:03 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/mocx4/:» ethat nick
04:04 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/mocx4/:» emisspelled your nick

18:29 #digitalocean: c7/ c7/Woet4/:» ei won't stop until you change your nick
